# Credit Card Default

Our client, a credit card company, provided a dataset containing demographic and financial data for **30,000 account holders** over the past six months. Each row represents a credit account, with a label indicating whether the account holder **defaulted** (failed to make the minimum payment) in the month following the six-month period.

The goal of this project is to develop a **predictive model** that forecasts **credit card defaults** based on demographic and financial data. Key tasks include **loading and exploring** the dataset using **pandas**, **creating visualizations** with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**, **implementing machine learning models** with **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**, and applying **regularization techniques** to reduce overfitting. The project also focuses on **evaluating model performance**, **interpreting predictions**, and delivering **actionable business recommendations** to improve **risk management strategies**.
