# Credit Card Default

Our client, a credit card company, has provided a dataset containing demographic and financial data from the past 6 months for 30,000 account holders. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a credit account, with a label indicating whether the account holder defaulted (failed to make the minimum payment) in the month following the 6 months.

The goal is to develop a predictive model to forecast whether an account will default in the next month based on demographic and financial data.
