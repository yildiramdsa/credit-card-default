# Credit Card Default

Our client is a credit card company that has provided us with a dataset containing demographic and recent financial data (spanning the past 6 months) for a sample of 30,000 account holders. The data is organized at the credit account level, meaning each row corresponds to an individual account. Each row is labelled based on whether the account holder defaulted, i.e., failed to make the minimum payment, in the month following the 6-month historical period.

Our objective is to develop a predictive model that forecasts whether an account will default in the next month, using demographic and historical financial data.
